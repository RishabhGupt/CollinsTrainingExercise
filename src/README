"Create a spring application using Maven with group id=com.rc.training, artifact id= springdemoxml. Use xml configuration.
Employee class contains an id and other details like name, salary, designation etc.
Define the following beans:
EmployeeRepository, EmployeeService
EmployeeRepository contains a repository of Employee objects.(stored as a HashMap). Defines below methods:
	getEmployees() -> Returns all employees
	addEmployee(Employee emp) ->Add single employee to the repository
	addEmployees(Employee... emps) ->Add multiple employees to repository
	clearRepository() -> Deletes all employees from the repository
EmployeeService uses EmployeeRepository. Defines below methods:
	logEmployees->sys out statements to display all employees
	validateEmployee(Employee emp)->Print error statements like Duplicate employee id, Negative employee id etc...
	addEmployee(Employee emp)-> Add employee to the repository after validating the employee
Repository should be initialized with some default data on app start up and cleared before the app context is destroyed.
The error messages should be defined in a property file, and retrieved from there while printing the validation errors.
Initialize the application context and demo the behaviour of the application for different scenarios.

Repeat the above in a new spring project with group id=com.rc.training, artifact id= springdemoannotation. Use annotation based configuration"
